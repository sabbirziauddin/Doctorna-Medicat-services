website name : Doctona medical service
the project is basically authentication based on firebase. i am using different kind of operation with firebase authentication.
user can log in with their github
when he logged in his name will be appeared in menu as signed in.when he will log out name will be disapper. 
i am using private route for this project.for example user want to take service but he is not logged in then it will redirect user to the loggin page .when he is login and take the services.
The another important issue is using dynamic router.
i am using context api rather props in some place
